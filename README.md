## Todo

- [ ] Add nice animation transition from `CityCard` to `WeatherCard`
- [ ] Lint
- [ ] Tests
    - [ ] Figure out why does CoreData crash in test env


## Summary

Really happy how the app turned out. Unfortunately I've wasted too much time debuging the test environment (Because of CoreData) that for right now I gave up on writing tests. It is in mt todo and I'll try and resolve them in time.
